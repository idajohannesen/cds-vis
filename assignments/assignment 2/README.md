The repo contains two classifier models, a logistic regression model and a neural network model. The function for either can be found in their respective scripts in the 'src' folder. 

The models were trained on the Cifar10 dataset which contains 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The data has been preprocessed through grayscaling, normalizing, and reshaping.

The 'output' folder contains a classification report for both models as well as a loss curve graph for the neural network.
